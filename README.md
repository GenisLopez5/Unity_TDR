# Unity_TDR
Repository of my unity project created to make my 2ÂºBACH (or 12th grade in USA) research project. 

Hello! I'm a student at Puigcerver School in Catalonia, Spain. While in our last 2 years before university, we have to finish a research project called TDR.
I've decided making a multiplayer survival game using Unity as the main part of the research project. I have 1 year of experience with Unity and I'll try my best to create this game.
I've been learning a lot doing this project, but there's still a lot to learn!.
I'll be updating any changes that I make to my self made assets like c# scripts, 3D models, textures and shaders. I'll also upload a release every day or so that will contain a build of the game in it's current progress.
